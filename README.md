# ETL Project

## Overview

This project involves developing **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines in Python to process, manipulate, and visualize financial data from various sources. The application features an interactive interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), allowing users to analyze asset portfolios, compare their performance to a reference index (benchmark), and explore results using dynamic charts.

## Main Features

- **Extraction of financial data** from multiple sources.
- **Transformation** and cleaning of data for analysis.
- **Loading** of transformed data into suitable structures.
- **Interactive visualization** of results with Streamlit and Matplotlib.
- **Portfolio comparison** with a benchmark (e.g., EuroNext100).
- **Object-oriented architecture** for modularity and maintainability.

## Usage

- Select the analysis period and the assets to include in your portfolio via the Streamlit interface.
- Run the analysis to display results, compare with the benchmark, and explore the generated charts.
